# Indian-Agriculture-Analysis-PowerBI
In this project, I utilised Microsoft Power BI to visualize the dataset and for interactive dashboards of Indian Agriculture. This helped me improve my analysis using Power BI dashboards.

## Overview:
This project's goal is to study Indian agriculture using district- and year-specific data. The collection offers exact data on agricultural acreage, productivity, and yields over many districts and years. This research helps stakeholders to make more informed decisions about sustainable farming and resource allocation.

## Project Objectives:
- Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of agricultural variables across districts and years.
- Analyze the trends in the cultivation of major crops, including rice, wheat, and pulses, focusing on changes in area, production, and yield.
- Identify disparities and variations in agricultural practices and outcomes across different districts and states.
- Explore seasonal patterns in crop cultivation, considering kharif and rabi seasons.
- Investigate the impact of external factors like weather conditions on crop performance.
- Analyze the cultivation trends of fruits, vegetables, and their overall contribution to agricultural practices.
- Derive insights that can contribute to promoting sustainable farming practices and optimizing resource allocation.

## Conclusion: 
In summary, this project utilized Microsoft Power BI to visualize district- and year-specific agricultural data, providing insights into trends, disparities, and opportunities for sustainable farming in India. The analysis enhances understanding of agricultural dynamics, aiding stakeholders in informed decision-making for policy and resource allocation.
