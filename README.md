# Indian-Agriculture-Analysis-PowerBI
In this project, I utilised Microsoft Power BI to visualize the dataset of Indian Agriculture. This helped me improve my analysis using Power BI dashboards.

## Overview:
This project's goal is to study Indian agriculture using district- and year-specific data. The collection offers exact data on agricultural acreage, productivity, and yields over many districts and years. This research helps stakeholders to make more informed decisions about sustainable farming and resource allocation.
